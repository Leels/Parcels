Parcels
Create a basic CRUD application for creating, updating and deleting Parcels. First, start with the backend logic, which should provide functionality to:

Create an instance of Parcel. A user should be able to specify the dimensions and weight of a Parcel.
Update an instance of Parcel.
Delete a Parcel.
View all Parcels.
Find an instance of Parcel.
When CRUD functionality is complete, add the following additional functionality:

Include a volume() instance method to calculate the volume of a Parcel.
Add a cost_to_ship() instance method. This will return a cost based on a formula you make up (you might consider factors like speed of delivery, distance, dimensions, weight).
Once the backend logic is complete and tested, build a website in Sinatra that lets users calculate shipping costs.
Make sure to commit regularly and create a README file.

For bonus points, consider:

offering gift wrapping services that require the surface area of the parcel to determine cost;
offering discounts based on size or date or some other property;
adding CSS/Bootstrap to enhance the user experience.
